   <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
   <p>So yeah,am Austin Karuru but you could call me <em>Karuru</em>. I've been in <a href="pioneer.secondary.school.co.ke/">Pioneer School</a> for the past for the past for years.
     I did my K.C.S.E last year and got A-,pretty lucky!! I was pretty bored until i heard of Moringa School from my cousin who's a developer at <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>.</p>
    <p>I was really fascinated to know that it takes a couple of codes to make a program, and thats why i joined Moringa.</p>
    <p>I hoped this school
      would give me the <br>
      necessary skills and experience to become <br>
      a successful developer</p>
    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Travelling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just to mention a few</p>
