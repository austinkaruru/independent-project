   <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
   <p>So yeah,am Austin Karuru but you could call me Karuru. I've been in <a href="pioneer.secondary.school.co.ke/">Pioneer School</a> for the past for the past for years.
     I did my K.C.S.E last year and got A-,pretty lucky!! I was pretty bored until i heard of Moringa School from my cousin who's a developer at <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>.</p>
    <p>I decided to join this school so i could learn how to develop programs. I was really fascinated to know that it takes a couple of codes to make a program. I hoped this school
      would give me the necessary skills and experience to become a successful developer</p>
